  Some believe that finding work is simply a numbers game - send out enough
  resumes, entertain enough interviews and it all works out in the end. Sadly
  however the percentages never work against anyone betting “against” the house.

Some believe that finding work is simply a numbers game - send out enough resumes, entertain enough interviews and it all works out in the end. Sadly however the percentages never work against anyone betting "against" the house.

Look at what happens when instead of losing at their game, you take control and get them to play "your game"! When job applicants control the math, watch what happens! Replace the employer collection of lots of resumes which acts against you as an applicant with a new approach which you control; where the numbers work in your favor.
