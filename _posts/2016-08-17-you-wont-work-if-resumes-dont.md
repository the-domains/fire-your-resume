title: You won’t work if Resumes don’t
publisher: {}
description: >-
  You seek work. In fact you suffer from chronic unemployment. You blame others
  for your situation as you well might; lazy guidance counsellors, your past
  employer, your significant other. All for a variety of reasons. Everyone
  complains. Even those who may find a job but quickly get bored, unhappy and
  start looking yet again.

# You won't work if Resumes don't
![The reluctant face of modern insanity](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33688d49-0123-42e9-bc00-1f128d219918.jpg)

You seek work. In fact you suffer from chronic unemployment. You blame others for your situation as you well might; lazy guidance counsellors, your past employer, your significant other. All for a variety of reasons. Everyone complains. Even those who may find a job but quickly get bored, unhappy and start looking yet again.

Ever considered placing blame on the inventor of the job resume? That is of course if you like the millions of lemmings out there continue to pump them out like so many paper sausages. Some attribute the following quote to Sigmund Freud, Modern Psychiatry's poster-boy:

> The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again (sending out resumes) while expecting a different (aka better) outcome (finding work).\[Paraphrase\]

Read carefully at what comes next as it breaks the chains of anyone caught in the vicious cycle of finding-work failure; you cannot find work using resumes because they don't work! Not really, not often and certainly not well. Many people, applicants and even employers painfully dislike Resumes for, yes, a variety of reasons.

Surprised to read that employers ask for them yet dislike them? No more surprising that you and your paper-cut fingers dislike printing them off or emailing them with the stumpy fingers left on your hands.

Future postings will share some key reasons why employers find them frustrating at the best of times. No one however will change their continued usage until someone finds a replacement. A way to escape the insanity.

That is something we will successfully do together.
