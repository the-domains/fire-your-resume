To find work we must think, speak and act like business-people instead of students or the unemployed or people (all sadly) struggling to get off of welfare. Good intentions do not fill bellies or bank accounts!

If you choose to move to Mexico, expect to speak Spanish and so it is with any workplace destination. You must speak the language. Resume scream out - give me a job, I want work, pay me! As it is, it's all about you. No wonder so many unsolicited resumes end up in the round-file (waste-paper basket) when dropped off. E-mail hardly works better as no one wants to read through hundreds/thousands of documents so they use software to filter-out those to not be seen, first. Either way, the system seems geared towards whom NOT to see.

So blind to our interests or the vast majority of people with whom we sit in the "Resume" file we do get lost in the shuffle. Not so much like a needle in a haystack to be found...more like a needle in a stack of needles.

Business, unless you choose to work in a non-profit organization or charitable organization build their seconds, minutes, hours and days on making a profit. Time equals money.

We must therefore approach the matter of employment, in the money-language of business, in terms of how much we bring to the table (revenue/profit) rather than how much we take away (cost/loss).

In business, talk is not cheap because it eats us valuable time.
