  In the insanity we call todayâ€™s job market, the young or anyone jumping back

In the insanity we call today's job market, the young or anyone jumping back into a job search suffers what I call Experience-22\. While easy to find many references to the CATCH-22 phenomena in discussions on unemployment, it seldom gets a full explanation to those far too young to know the movie or book (Author Joseph Heller) by the same name. It speaks of a riddle inside of a puzzle, an inescapable contradiction of logic exemplified by Yossarian, a soldier, wanting to stop flying dangerous bombing runs in WWII.

Adding to the insanity of repeatedly using Resumes that don't work, resulting in an effort that fails to find work, you now have Experience-22; Employers seek applicants with history but refuse to hire the inexperienced so they can gain it. The complaint resonates loud and clear - how can I get experience to get hired if no one will hire me to gain the experience needed to get hired...and so on.

Another quote from the book and film indicates that Yossarian will do everything he can to stay alive, even if he must die trying! Humour aside, the solution rises from that ironic statement. To win a lottery you must buy a ticket. To stop losing at Casinos you must first stop going to Casinos to gamble.

We must leave the world of resumes, cover letters and even interviews to break free of the insanity. Otherwise we get pulled back to a no-win, Experience-22 zero-sum game. Stopping of course is not enough. We must replace it with something better - so let's do just that!
