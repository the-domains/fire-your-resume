The fact remains that gamblers who flock to Vegas and keep Sin-City alive and well do so because they lose regularly, in lemming-like droves. It seems the longer you stay at the tables or slot machines the more you are GUARANTEED to lose!

Does looking longer for work when the numbers are stacked against you make any more sense? If you get less for each amount you invest, you end up in the end losing.

Just look at what happens when you play their game, their way!
